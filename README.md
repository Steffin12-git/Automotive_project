## üìä Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following datasets:

* **electric\_vehicle\_sales\_by\_state.csv**: Monthly sales data for electric and total vehicles across various states and vehicle categories (2-Wheeler, 4-Wheeler).
* **electric\_vehicle\_sales\_by\_makers.csv**: Monthly sales data for electric vehicles by individual manufacturers and vehicle categories.
* **dim\_date.csv**: A date dimension table to facilitate time-series analysis and filter data by fiscal year and quarter.
* **meta\_data.txt**: Key definitions for metrics like Penetration Rate and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).

## üìå Key Metrics and DAX Measures

Several custom DAX measures were created to address the business questions, including:

* **Penetration Rate**: Calculates the proportion of electric vehicles sold relative to the total vehicle sales.
* **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**: Computes the yearly growth rate in EV and total vehicle sales between 2022 and 2024.
* **Revenue Growth Rate**: Estimates revenue growth using average unit prices of EVs.
* **Top N/Bottom N Ranking Filters**: Used to dynamically filter states or makers based on top or bottom N performance in penetration or sales.
* **Forecasting Future Sales**: Projects sales for 2030 using CAGR assumptions.
